### The Life Cycle of Stars (Script for a Video Essay)  
## [Opening Scene: A dazzling view of the Milky Way galaxy with a serene voiceover.]
Voiceover: "In the vastness of the universe, stars are born, live extraordinary lives, and eventually meet their end. But their deaths are not truly the end—they give birth to new stars and elements, fueling the cosmic cycle of life."  

## [Scene transition to a star-forming nebula.]
Voiceover: "The journey of a star begins in a stellar nursery, a nebula filled with gas and dust. Gravity pulls this material together, forming a protostar. As pressure and temperature rise, nuclear fusion ignites, marking the birth of a star."  

## [Footage of stars of varying sizes.]
Voiceover: "Not all stars are created equal. Their mass determines their life story. Small stars, like red dwarfs, burn fuel slowly and can live for billions of years. Medium-sized stars, like our Sun, have shorter lifespans, ending their lives as white dwarfs. Massive stars live fast and die young, ending in spectacular supernovae."  

## [Scene showing a supernova explosion.]
Voiceover: "When a massive star runs out of fuel, its core collapses, and the outer layers are ejected in a supernova. This cosmic explosion creates heavy elements, scattering them across the universe."  

[Visuals of neutron stars and black holes.]
Voiceover: "The remnants of a supernova depend on the star's original mass. It may become a neutron star—a dense core—or, if massive enough, a black hole, where gravity is so intense not even light can escape."  

## [Closing Scene: A starry sky with the Sun shining brightly.]
Voiceover: "Stars are the architects of the universe, creating elements that form planets, life, and everything we know. The life cycle of stars is a testament to the beauty and interconnectedness of the cosmos."
